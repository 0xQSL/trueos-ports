#
# This script supports running multiple instances of mlvpn
# To run additional instances link this script to something like
# % ln -s mlvpn mlvpn_foo
# and define additional mlvpn_foo_* variables in one of
# /etc/rc.conf, /etc/rc.conf.local or /etc/rc.conf.d/mlvpn_foo
#
# Below NAME should be substituted with the name of this script. By default
# it is mlvpn, so read as mlvpn_enable. If you linked the script to
# mlvpn_foo, then read as mlvpn_foo_enable etc.
#
# The following variables are supported (defaults are shown).
# You can place them in any of
# /etc/rc.conf, /etc/rc.conf.local or /etc/rc.conf.d/NAME
#
# NAME_enable="NO"	# set to YES to enable mlvpn
# NAME_if=		# driver(s) to load, set to "tun", "tap" or "tun tap"
#			# it is OK to specify the if_ prefix.
#
# # optional:
# NAME_flags=				# additional command line arguments
# NAME_configfile="/usr/local/etc/mlvpn/NAME.conf"	# --config file
#
# Note that we deliberately refrain from unloading drivers.
#
# For further documentation, please see http://www.mlvpn.fr/
