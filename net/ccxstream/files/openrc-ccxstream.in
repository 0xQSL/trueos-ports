# Define these ccxstream_* variables in one of these files:
#       /etc/rc.conf
#       /etc/rc.conf.local
#       /etc/rc.conf.d/ccxstream
#
# DO NOT CHANGE THESE DEFAULT VALUES HERE!
# 
# The port will refuse to start unless ccxstream_flags is initalized,
# in addition to ccxstream_enable. For information on the arguments
# to ccxstream, look at %%PREFIX%%/share/doc/ccxstream/README (if you
# installed the port documentation by not specifying NOPORTDOCS) or the
# output of "ccxstream -h". At bare minimum, you'll want to add the
# "-u <user>" argument to specify the userid the server will run under
# (unless you WANT to run this code as root), and the "-r <directory>"
# argument to configure the directory root that the server will share
# from.
# 
# Don't worry about the "-f" (background) and "-F <pidfile>" arguments;
# this script takes care of them for you.
