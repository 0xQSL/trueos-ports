# When iked_ramdisk is set to YES, the rc.d script will make sure
# all directories exist, but will not generate a key pair if none
# exists.  The daemon is not started when the key pair no config
# files are missing.  It is assumed the ramdisk is not populated
# completely.  When iked_ramdisk is NO, key pairs are created as
# needed and thr daemon is started unconditionally.
