Falkon (formerly called QupZilla) is a new and very fast QtWebEngine browser 
which aims to be a lightweight web browser available for all major platforms. 

Falkon has all the standard functions you expect from a web browser. It includes
bookmarks, history (both also in sidebar) and tabs. Above that, you can manage
RSS feeds with an included RSS reader, block ads with a builtin AdBlock plugin,
block Flash content with Click2Flash and edit the local CA Certificate
database with an SSL Manager.
