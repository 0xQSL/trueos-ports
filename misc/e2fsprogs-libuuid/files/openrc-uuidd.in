#
# rcNG script to start uuidd at boot-time on rcNG-enabled systems,
# such as FreeBSD.  Note: Starting uuidd at boot-time is not strictly 
# necessary, the library will - as of 1.41.5 - silently launch an 
# instance of uuidd that exits after 300 seconds; for most accurate 
# time-based uuids generated from unprivileged user accounts it may be 
# useful to run it system-wide.
